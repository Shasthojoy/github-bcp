# Introduction

# Experiences from Current WGs Actively Using GitHub

## HTTPBIS

## TLS

## ACME

## CORE

\[blame Carsten Bormann for this subsection]

The CoRE WG (Constrained RESTful Environments) has been actively using
the Trac/SVN combination offered by the Tools Team for its older
drafts.
Some newer drafts (including some drafts that are not yet WG drafts
but could be considered candidates for that) are now being worked on
in the `core-wg` github organization.
These drafts generally use Martin Thomson's template, except where the
build process (examples, grammars) is much more complicated than can
easily be supported by this template.

We try to keep discussion on the mailing list (as opposed to getting
them entirely in the github issues), but may not have been very
successful in that; it definitely requires constant vigilance.

The [WG Wiki](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/core/wiki) says:

> With respect to the mode of operation of the repository, the CoRE WG
> follows the lead of the HTTPBIS WG [add link here]. Specifically
> that means that github issues are welcome to record editorial issues
> as well as technical ones; as are "pull requests" (forks of the
> repository with fixes for an issue). However, technical discussion
> should not happen in the forums implicitly created by the issues,
> but on the WG mailing list.

We currently do not have an active backup regime.
